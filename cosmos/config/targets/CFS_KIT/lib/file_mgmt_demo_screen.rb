Application command execution counters typically mean a command has been successfully processed. \
However there are often situations when a command may take a while to process and the activity can\
occur in the background. In these situations a child task performs the function and its command\
execution counters (pass/fail) indicate whether the command was completed sucessfully. The parent\
application's execution counter simply means the command was successfuly/unsucessfully parsed and\
passed to the shild task."
