/*
** Purpose:  Define a class that provides a mechanism for objects to report faults
**
** Notes:
**   1. This code was originally acquired from the NASA cFS External Code
**      Interface (ECI) NOSA release. Several cosmetic changes have been made
**      but it remains functionally very similar.
**   2. This code must be reentrant and no global data can be used. 
**   3. FaultRep_Constructor() must be called prior to any other FaultRep_ 
**      functions
**   4. The telemetry generation requires that an even number of fault
**      detection points be defined. This file requires the number of fault
**      detection points to be a multiple of 16 so the telemetry generation
**      restriction should always be satisfied.
**   5. This object does not associate any meaning to the IDs.
**   6. Typically multiple detection points are "ORed" together for a single
**      fault correction monitor point. This object assumes the combining
**      of fault detection points is accomplished outside of this object.
**   7. The ReportMode flag has the following definitions
**      - FAULTREP_NEW_REPORT - The ID notifications for the current control cycle
**        are copied into the message.
**      - FAULTREP_MERGE_REPORT - The ID notifications for the current control cycle
**        are merged(logically ORed) with the message
**   8. Each Application can customized the following macros:
**      - FAULTREP_ID_MAX
